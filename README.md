## 1. Executive Summary

MapleDash Grocers, a simulated e-grocery retailer, operates a multi-warehouse fulfillment network across the Greater Toronto Area, supporting high-volume, time-sensitive customer demand. While core systems such as the Inventory Management System (IMS), Warehouse Management System (WMS), and Order Management System (OMS) are in place, inventory operations rely heavily on manual coordination, delayed updates, and supervisor-driven controls.

A data-driven assessment revealed that operational challenges stem not from missing systems, but from execution gaps between physical warehouse activities and system-recorded inventory states. These gaps manifest as inventory inaccuracies, ATP overselling, uneven stock distribution, frequent replenishment exceptions, and preventable picking disruptions.

This Business Analysis project defines a targeted IMS enhancement approach focused on system-directed execution, automated inventory updates, and exception-based human intervention across five core processes:
- Receiving  
- Putaway  
- Cycle Counting  
- Replenishment  
- Order Picking  

The solution deliberately avoids full system replacement or enterprise-grade integrations, aligning with MapleDash’s operational maturity and growth trajectory.

The outcome is a disciplined, scalable inventory execution model that improves inventory accuracy, fulfillment reliability, and operational efficiency without introducing unnecessary complexity or cost.

## 2. Problem Statement and Strategic Context

MapleDash’s fulfillment model depends on accurate inventory visibility, reliable replenishment, and disciplined execution across multiple warehouses. As order volumes and SKU complexity increased, operational processes failed to scale at the same pace.

The core problem is misalignment between physical inventory movements and system updates, leading to:

- Delayed or inconsistent inventory synchronization after receiving, putaway, replenishment, and cycle counting  
- Excessive supervisor intervention for routine discrepancies  
- SKU-level stock imbalances masked by healthy-looking aggregate KPIs  
- ATP overselling and pick-time shortages despite sufficient total inventory  
- Reactive replenishment behavior driven by execution gaps rather than demand signals  

Strategically, MapleDash does not need a full system replacement or advanced automation to resolve these challenges. What is required is stronger execution discipline, system-directed workflows for routine activities, and clear exception thresholds that focus human effort where it adds the most value.

This initiative directly addresses that need while remaining aligned with MapleDash’s size, maturity, and growth trajectory.

## 3. How Data Analysis Informed the Business Analysis

This Business Analysis initiative is evidence-led. A dedicated Data Analysis was conducted during discovery using Power BI dashboards and KPI diagnostics to establish a fact-based understanding of MapleDash’s current-state operations before defining requirements or solutions.

The data analysis did **not** propose solutions. Instead, it surfaced where execution breaks down and where operational risk accumulates, enabling informed BA decisions.

Key contributions of the data analysis phase included:

- Identifying inventory accuracy risk through ATP overselling, SKU-level stock imbalances, and delayed adjustments  
- Revealing demand volatility patterns using ABC–XYZ classification to highlight high-risk SKUs  
- Exposing uneven inventory distribution via Days of Cover vs. Median Sellable Coverage analysis  
- Highlighting warehouse-level throughput imbalance across fulfillment centers  
- Providing supplier reliability context (OTD%, lead time variability, supplier concentration) as an external risk factor, not a system failure  

These insights directly informed:

- TO-BE process design decisions  
- Business rules and exception thresholds  
- Automation boundaries  
- KPI selection and success metrics  
- Scope and constraints defined in the Business Case and BRD  

In short, data analysis diagnosed the problem space, while business analysis translated those signals into structured requirements and solution design.

## 4. Solution Approach

The proposed solution is a **process-led IMS enhancement**, not a technology overhaul. It strengthens how inventory decisions are executed, validated, and recorded across the warehouse network.

### Core Design Principles

**System-Directed, Not System-Replaced**  
The IMS actively guides routine work such as receiving validation, putaway location selection, replenishment triggers, risk-based cycle count task generation, and automated pick task creation.

**Automation with Control Points**  
Inventory updates occur automatically only after validated execution steps, ensuring Quantity on Hand (QOH) and Available-to-Promise (ATP) reflect physical reality rather than assumptions.

**Exception-Based Human Intervention**  
Supervisors are engaged only when predefined tolerance thresholds are breached. Routine activities proceed without manual approval, reducing firefighting and cognitive load.

**Single Version of Inventory Truth**  
Inventory deductions and adjustments occur at clearly defined control points, eliminating duplicate updates and reconciliation confusion.

**Pragmatic Integration**  
Data synchronization between IMS, WMS, and OMS is lightweight and reliability-focused, avoiding real-time orchestration complexity.

Together, these principles convert inventory operations from reactive and manual to disciplined, scalable, and auditable while remaining appropriate for a mid-sized e-grocery organization.

## 5. KPIs and Value Alignment

KPI alignment ensures that the proposed solution delivers measurable business value, not just process improvement. The IMS enhancements are explicitly designed to influence execution-driven KPIs that reflect inventory accuracy, availability, and operational stability.

### How the Solution Impacts Key KPIs

- **Inventory Accuracy & Availability**:
Improved execution discipline and controlled inventory updates reduce ATP overselling, stabilize Total ATP Quantity, and improve Inventory Turnover, Days of Inventory, Days of Cover, and Median Sellable Coverage.

- **Replenishment & Stock Control**:
System-driven replenishment triggers and exception thresholds reduce the percentage of SKUs falling below Reorder Point (ROP) and Safety Stock.

- **Risk & Loss Exposure**:
Better putaway discipline, FEFO enforcement, and timely adjustments reduce expiry exposure and protect unit economics.

- **Demand & Fulfillment Context**:
Improved execution stability supports consistent fulfillment performance under volatile demand without overreactive manual intervention.

- **Supplier Risk Context (Observed, Not Controlled)**:
Supplier OTD%, lead time, and concentration metrics are monitored as external risk indicators that inform execution safeguards, not as levers controlled by this project.

These KPIs form the basis for post-implementation monitoring and benefits realization tracking.

## 6. Estimated Benefits and Expected Outcomes

Based on current-state baselines identified during data analysis, the proposed solution is expected to deliver measurable operational improvements within six months of implementation, assuming disciplined adoption.

### Key Expected Outcomes

- **Improved Inventory Turnover:** Inventory Turnover is expected to increase from 6.5x to approximately 8.0x, driven by better alignment between demand velocity and stock placement, reduced overstocking in slow-moving categories, and faster  execution cycles.  
- **Reduced ATP Overselling:** The percentage of SKUs oversold (ATP < 0) is expected to drop from 2.9% to below 1%, as inventory updates are synchronized with validated execution events.  
- **Lower Replenishment Risk:** SKUs below Reorder Point (ROP) are expected to reduce from 17.3% to under 10%, reflecting more timely and consistent replenishment triggers.  
- **Lean Inventory Position:** Days of Inventory are expected to decrease from 56 days to 50 days or less, improving working capital efficiency without increasing stockout risk.  
- **Tighter SKU-Level Coverage:** Median Sellable Coverage is expected to reduce from 33 days to approximately 30 days, indicating more balanced inventory distribution across SKUs.  

These outcomes represent execution efficiency gains, not demand growth assumptions, and are consistent with the scope and responsibility of an IMS-led process enhancement initiative.

## 7. Why This Is a Realistic SMB Project

This initiative deliberately avoids overengineering:

- Supplier performance issues are observed and mitigated through execution controls, not solved through sourcing changes  
- Automation is rule-based, not AI-driven  
- Integrations are lightweight, not real-time enterprise orchestration  
- Improvements focus on execution discipline, not organizational restructuring  

This makes the solution realistic, defensible, and achievable within MapleDash’s operational context.
